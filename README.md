# Shopify extensibility custom Shipping message checkout App Template - Remix

This is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using the [Remix](https://remix.run) framework.

<!-- TODO: Uncomment this after we've started using the template in the CLI -->
<!-- Rather than cloning this repo, you can use your preferred package manager and the Shopify CLI with [these steps](#installing-the-template). -->

## Step 1: Setup Shopify app and install it on store

### Prerequisites

1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
2. You must [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you donâ€™t have one.
3. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).

<!-- TODO Make this section about using @shopify/app once it's added to the CLI. -->
